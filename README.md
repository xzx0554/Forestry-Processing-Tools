Crown and Trunk Separation Tool: A GUI-based program that selects a folder and reads all CSV files within it, including those in subfolders. On the left side, there is a list displaying all CSV files (which store point cloud data), along with a counter. The main screen is divided into two sections, with the left side showing the XZ projection and the right side showing the YZ projection (both with axes). There is an input box at the bottom of the screen for entering a numerical value corresponding to the Z-axis. When a number is entered and the "Confirm" button is clicked, a red line is displayed on the screen, corresponding to the Z-axis. After clicking "Save," a file with the same name but appended with "_crown" is saved in the original file path.
